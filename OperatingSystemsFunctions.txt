One operating system function that I find interesting is memory management. Memory management is the process of coordinating and controlling a computer's primary memory.
In this process, the operating system assigns portions that are called blocks to numerous running programs. This process helps optimize the overall system performance. It also
manages the memory that resides in things such as hardware, programs, and applications. The memory management functions also keep track of both the allocated and free memory locations.
